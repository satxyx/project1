# journ.ey
We've created a sleek, minimalistic journaling app. One that the user can find daily peace in as they express their thoughts and decompress through thoughtful, written meditation.

## User Stories
### Who is the user?
Our user is you, me, and everyone who likes to put their thoughts on down when they get too loud but also craves a zen-like experience when they do. 

### Existing Features
* Login Page - the user can login to their journal 
* Signup Page - the user can sign up to use our app and is redirected back to the login page
* Welcome Page - the user is greated on a customized welcom page with a simple nav bar, in the right hand corner, and buttons for choosing if they want to see their profile, all their entries, or create a new entry
* All Entries Page - a gorgous, carousel styled index of all the user's journal entries that they can scroll through with key press
* Create Entry - a form renders that allows the user to make a journal entry 
* Update Entry - a prefilled form renders with the user's entry info that they can update however they wish and save
* Visual Inspiration - a responsive image gallery of pictures await the user's eye, to help get their creativity flowing
* Profile Page - the user is able to view their profile information
* Update Profile - the user is able to change their information and have it savaed to our db

## Planned Features
If we continued to work on our project, we'd like to create solutions for the features listed below:
* Theme Switching
* Having the visual inspiration page's pictures change on a timer
* Having image upload work in the text editor
* Password Hashing
* User being able to lock specific journal entries

## Triumphs
Our triumphs ran both sides of design and functionality with this app. We were able to solve the problem of passing data to our navbar based on which user was signed in and taking them to the correct pages for their account. This allowed the user to be able to navigate freely and easily throught our app. 

## Challenges
Being able to execute all our user experience goals within the time frame turned out to be a challenge. For example, we were unable to implement alerts in our ejs files that would indicate to the user when they were logged out, not signed up with us, or had the incorrect username/password. Though, it provided a great learning experience for prioritizing the minimum functionalities we needed for our user to be able to enjoy our able.
