We’ve created a sleek, minimalist journaling app. One that the user can find daily peace in as they express their thoughts and decompress through thoughtful, written meditation.

## Planned Features

## Triumphs
Our triumphs ran both sides of design and functionality with this app. We were able to solve the problem of passing data to our navbar base on which user was signed in and taking them to the correct pages for their account. Thi swallowed the user to be able to navigate freely and easily throughout our app. 

## Challenges
Being able to execute all our user experience goals within the time frame turned out to be a challenge, for example, we were unable to implement alerts in our ejs files that would indicate to the user when they were logged out, not signed up with us, or had the incorrect username/password. It provided a great learning experience for prioritizing the minimum functionalities we needed for our user to enjoy our site.
